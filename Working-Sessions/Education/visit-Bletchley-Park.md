This session takes a step back from current pressing cyber-security concerns and travels back in time to the place where, in a sense, it all began, nearby [Bletchley Park](https://bletchleypark.org.uk/).

Enemy messages were decrypted at Bletchley Park during WW II. This capability was a closely guarded secret and turned out to be of decisive importance to the outcome of the war.

This is the place where Alan Turing designed the Bombe in 1939 to decrypt messages produced by German Enigma machines. The Colossus series, arguably the world's first programmable electronic digital computers, were designed and built here between 1943 and 1945 to break the Lorenz cipher.

## Why

This historic place is now a museum, or, perhaps more accurately, a cluster of temporary and permanent exhibitions, including

* [Museum in Block B](https://bletchleypark.org.uk/visit-us/what-to-see/museum-in-block-b) containing original Enigma machines, a fully operational Bombe rebuild and a gallery dedicated to the life and work of Alan Turing.
* [The National Museum of Computing](http://www.tnmoc.org/) is also on the Bletchley Park campus, featuring a rebuild of Colossus.
* [An exhibition celebrating the centenary of Bill Tutte](https://bletchleypark.org.uk/whats-on/bill-tutte-mathematician-codebreaker), a key figure in breaking the Lorenz cipher and building Colossus.

## What

The Bletchley Park campus opens at 9:30 AM and closes at 5 PM - latest admission is 4 PM. The current proposal is to spend the afternoon there, visiting the exhibits listed above, but this is open for discussion. Feel free to add to the list.

If 12 or more sign up, we can get a guided tour.

We also need to know what arrangements we need to make for transport. So, if you intend to come, please indicate whether you need transport or can take people.

### Transport Arrangements:

Have vehicle with N open slots:
